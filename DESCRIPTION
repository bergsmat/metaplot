Title: Formalized Plots For Self-Describing Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Tim Bergsma
Maintainer: Tim Bergsma <bergsmat@gmail.com>
Description: Creates fully-annotated plots with minimum guidance.
 Since the data is self-describing, less effort is needed for
 creating the plot. Requires data of class 'folded' (use origami::fold).
 If attributes 'GUIDE' and 'LABEL' are present, they will be used
 to create formal axis labels. Several aesthetics are supported, such
 as reference lines, unity lines, smooths, and log transformations.
